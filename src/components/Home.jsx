            I was born in Kansas City MO. My time growing up with family included discovering my passion for technology, music, and lots of other forms of art and expression. I found myelf messing with computers, taking apart kids toys, smashing on pots and pans as drum sets, and rocking out with my mothers kitchen broom while listening to my first Eagles CD. Growing up into an adult I dug into my passion for music, and coupled that with going to Cosmetology school where I successfully became a liscenced cosmetologist and a liscenced instructor. I love the art of hair, and runway, and till this day it remains a deep passion of mine.

While pursuing my love for music and visual arts I decided to expand who I was as a professional and dig into my "techy" side. Working with computers, building websites and apps, even graphic design.
